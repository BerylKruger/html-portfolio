<h1>Beryl's Favourite Movies</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Serenity</h3>
<p>This movie is the best mix of sci-fi meets western, meets action and adventure with some romance in the mix as well as a boatload of wit.</p>
<h3>Forest Gump</h3>
<p>I never get tired of rewatching this classic that was a pioneer in CGI. It is an endearing story of a very plain and unassuming man. From childhood to fatherhood, enduring various challenges without ever complaining of the cards life dealt him</p>
<h3>Book of Eli</h3>
<p>A man of faith traveling through a post apocolyptic world, on a mission to deliver the last copy of a very important book. The plot twist was amazing</p>
